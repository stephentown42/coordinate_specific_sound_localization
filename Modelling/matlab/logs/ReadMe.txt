Initial and Fitted refer to the model parameters in the same order as specified by the likelihood function


CF8_FullAllo_Theta

Sound angle in the world is used to model responses



Note: We can't directly compare behavior of animals trained in head and world centred tasks, because the response
space is not equivalent. What we can do however, is compare models using sound angle in head (CF10) and world (CF8)
centred space
