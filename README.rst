Sound localization by ferrets in head and world-centred space
===============================================================

--------
Summary

The ability to localize sounds is a fundamental component of human and non-human hearing, in which we integrate sounds from the two ears, as well as non-auditory information about head pose to compute the position of sounds in multiple coordinate systems.In particular, it is critical that we map sounds into our local environment, so that our perception of auditory scences remains stable when we move. While humans perceive world-centred sound location, whether other species also experience a continuous world-centred sound space is unclear. Here, we asked if ferrets could be trained to report the location of sounds in two independent coordinate systems centered on either the animal's head, or the environment in which the task was performed.

To address this, we began with a two choice discrimination task, in which subjects reported the location of a speaker by visiting an arbritrary response port. In the world-centred task, speaker and response locations were fixed in the environment so that, for example, subjects reported sounds from a North speaker at a West port. Across trials, we varied the head direction at which animals initiated sound presentation in 30° intervals across 360°, so that cues about head-centred sound location were informative. In the head-centred task, sound locations were fixed relative to the animal (e.g. report sounds from in front by visiting the right port). As the animal's head direction changed, both sounds and response ports rotated as well, so that subjects were required to generalize across sound location in the world. 

We found that ferrets could be trained in either task, and that individual subjects could successfully discriminate either world-centred sound location across changes in sound position relative to the head, or head-centred sound location across changes in sound position in the world. Animals performed accurately on even the first trial after changes in head direction, demonstrating that behavior resulted from successful generalization of sound location rather than rapid relearning. Control experiments in which individual speakers were swapped confirmed that task performance was based on sound location rather than the specific sound sources used in the experiment. Critically, testing responses to probes sounds at untrained locations (e.g. North-West) also showed that animals were reporting sounds using continuous spaces to report sound location, rather than simply categorizing space into discrete zones.

These results demonstrate that ferrets have access to both the location of sounds in head and world-centred space. The ability to locate sounds in the world indicates that, like humans, other animals can integrate information about head pose with auditory signal processing to build stable representations of the auditory environment.

Repository Structure
------------------------

This repository aims to support dissemination of research findings and provide methodological transparency. To achieve this, there are three main components:
- **Methods**: Code used to coordinate behavioral testing
- **Data**: Both primary data resulting from experiments and processed data files used in analysis
- **Analysis**: Code used to analyse results, make figures and draw inferences about behavior
- **Tests**: Tests and simulation scripts / data to check everything is doing what it should
