Data

---------
  Original
---------
Text files created by the data acquisition system during each test session. The naming and formatting 
of these files is not ideal, and having hundreds of source files for each subject is less convenient 
than one single file, nicely organised for the analysis (which is the point of this section)


--------
  Summary
--------
An interim format - one CSV file per subject, saved after loading behavioral data from many original files, but before most
of the calculations of sound angles and conversion of indices into meaningful values happens. The point of these files it 
to have the convenience of single files, but also the flexibility of having all the trials. As we go on to format the data,
we will exclude trials (e.g. correction trials) that might not be admissible in the main analysis, but might be of interest
if we were doing something else (e.g. looking at trial history to predict future behavior)


----------
  Formatted
----------
These are the data files used in the main analysis. Correction trials have been removed, as have any trials with repeating 
stimuli (these were used for rare cases - mostly with Flan, with whom we ran out of time)


----------
  Subjects
----------
Data in this repository includes all animals who completed testing (F1701, F1703, F1810, F1811, F1901, F1902 and F1905)
