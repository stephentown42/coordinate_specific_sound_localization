Analysis of individual behavior produces plots of task performance for each animal and the
probability of making repsonses as a function of sound angle in the world, relative to the 
head, or both.

Group behavior is when we combine across multiple subjects with comparable training conditions 
to look at responses as a function of both sound angle in the world and relative to the head.

Results from swapping speakers are shown using **plot_swap_data.py** - note here that the speaker
identity here is not listed independently of speaker location, and thus the source data is 
split into sessions before and after swap.

The same analysis is applied to subjects performing head and world-centered tasks, but the 
results for these tasks is reported separately. The output figures in this repository are 
thus reorganized for publications.
