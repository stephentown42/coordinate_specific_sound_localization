------------------
Main
------------------
Analysis used to measure the performance (% correct) of ferrets performing each task
and obtain the response probabilities as a function of sound angle in each coordinate
system

------------------
Within Session Learning
------------------
Branch of main analysis used to check whether animals performance improved over the 
session by compare performance (% correct) during the first and last *K* trials of 
each session. 

------------------
Speaker Swaps
------------------
Control experiment checking whether animals used speaker identity or location to solve task.

------------------
Cross Coordiantes
------------------
Data from tasks in which animals reported sound location from one coordinate system (e.g. the 
world) in a response space defined by the other space (e.g. the head). 

------------------
One Shot Generalization
------------------
Exploratory analysis of animals responses on the first trial after rotation by 180Â°
